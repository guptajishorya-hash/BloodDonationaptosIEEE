# Blockchain-based Blood Donation Tracker

## Description of the Project

The Blockchain-based Blood Donation Tracker is a decentralized application built on the Aptos blockchain that creates a transparent, immutable, and trustworthy system for tracking blood donations. This smart contract addresses critical challenges in blood donation management by providing a secure platform where donors can register their donations and hospitals or blood banks can verify donation records.

The contract implements two essential functionalities:
- **Donor Registration**: Allows individuals to create donor profiles with their blood type information stored securely on-chain
- **Donation Recording**: Enables authorized entities to record new blood donations, automatically updating the donor's contribution history

Key features include:
- **Immutable Records**: All donation history is permanently stored on the blockchain, preventing tampering or data loss
- **Blood Type Tracking**: Maintains accurate records of donor blood types for emergency matching
- **Donation Counter**: Automatically tracks the total number of donations per individual
- **Transparent Verification**: Anyone can verify donation records, ensuring authenticity and building trust
- **Privacy-Focused**: Only essential information is stored while maintaining donor privacy

The system leverages Aptos blockchain's security and transparency to create a reliable foundation for blood donation management that can be trusted by donors, hospitals, blood banks, and regulatory authorities.

## Vision of the Project

Our vision is to revolutionize blood donation management through blockchain technology, creating a global, transparent, and efficient ecosystem that saves lives by ensuring reliable access to safe blood supplies worldwide.

**Core Vision Elements:**
- **Global Blood Network**: Create an interconnected global system where blood donations can be tracked across borders, enabling international cooperation during emergencies
- **Life-Saving Transparency**: Eliminate fraud and corruption in blood donation systems through immutable blockchain records
